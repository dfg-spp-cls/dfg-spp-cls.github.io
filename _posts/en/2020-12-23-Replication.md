In the Digital Humanities, and particularly in Computational Literary Studies (CLS), there is an increasing awareness of the crucial role played by replication in evidence-based research. Relevant disciplinary developments include the increased importance of evaluation in text analysis and the increased interest in making research transparent through publicly accessible data and code (open source, open data). 

To address this topic, [Huyghens ING](https://en.huygens.knaw.nl/?noredirect=en_GB), [Cornell University](https://infosci.cornell.edu/), [DARIAH-DE](https://de.dariah.eu/en/home) and the Priority Programme [Computational Literary Studies](https://dfg-spp-cls.github.io/) are organizing the virtual Workshop "Replication and Computational Literary Studies"
