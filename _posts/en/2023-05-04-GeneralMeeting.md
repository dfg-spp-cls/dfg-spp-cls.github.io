In its first general meeting of the second funding period the DFG Priority Programme *Computational Literary Studies* (CLS) will re-initiatiate cross-project collaborations. Our working groups are aimed at sharing ideas and know how, but also data like code, language models and annotated text for model training. During the upcoming meeting, working groups will present themselves and explore potential activities for the second funding phase. The programme sees itself as an open community; CLS researchers from outside the (funded part of the) programme interested in participating in our working groups are welcome explicitly encouraged to join.
